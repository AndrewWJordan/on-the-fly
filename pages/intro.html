<h1>It's nice to meet you</h1>
	<div class="body-content">
	    <p>My name is Andrew Jordan.  I am a software engineer for Marist College in Poughkeepsie, New York and have been employed there for over two years.  My job at Marist is unique in that I support the college, its website and web applications, but also build solutions for external clients.  Our clients have included The Rockefeller Foundation, FDR's Presidential Library, Walkway Over the Hudson, the College of New Rochelle, and many more.</p>

	    <p>Each client was unique in terms of their needs, so I was exposed to many different technologies and programming languages.  This has allowed me to become a competent front and back-end engineer.</p>

	    <p>My job at Marist has exposed me to the Agile methodologies, the Scrum process, and allowed me to mentor our staff of up to sixteen student workers.</p>  

	    <p>My experience as a developer goes as far back as high school and has stuck with me through all of these years.  I was a self-starter back then and am a commited life-long learner today.  I have a passion for learning new technologies that continue to allow me to be creative while also solving problems for others.</p>
